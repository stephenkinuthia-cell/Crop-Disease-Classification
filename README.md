## 🚀 Project Name
**Crop Disease Classification in Uganda**

## 📌 Description
This project builds and optimizes a convolutional neural network to classify crop disease images from Uganda into five categories using transfer learning and training optimization techniques.

## 🎯 Motivation / Problem Solved
In Uganda and many other developing regions, crop diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity and food security. Automating crop disease detection can help farmers take early action, reduce losses, and increase yields. This project addresses the problem using AI and machine learning.

## ✨ Features
- Visualize and explore a real-world dataset
- Build custom CNNs for multiclass classification
- Apply transfer learning using pre-trained models (ResNet)
- Implement advanced training callbacks
- Evaluate performance using k-fold cross-validation
- Raise awareness about AI’s environmental and ethical impact

---

### 🖼️ Lesson 2: Explore Datasets
**Summary**: Explored and analyzed crop disease image datasets.

**Topics Covered**:
- Data normalization
- Class balancing

**New Terms**:
- **Unbalanced classes**: Unequal number of samples per class.
- **Undersampling**: Reducing data in overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.

---

### 🧠 Lesson 3: Multiclass Classification
**Summary**: Built and trained a CNN to classify images into five categories.

**Topics Covered**:
- Grayscale to RGB conversion
- Image resizing and normalization
- Model training and overfitting detection

**New Terms**:
- **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
- **Learning Curve**: Graph showing model performance over training epochs.

---

### 🔄 Lesson 4: Transfer Learning
**Summary**: Used a pre-trained model (ResNet) for faster and more accurate classification.

**Topics Covered**:
- Loading and altering pre-trained models
- Training specific layers only
- k-fold cross-validation

**New Terms**:
- **Pre-trained model**: A model already trained on a large dataset.
- **Transfer learning**: Reusing a model on a new but similar task.
- **k-fold Cross-validation**: Splitting data into k parts to train and validate the model k times.

---

### 🛠️ Lesson 5: Callbacks
**Summary**: Implemented callbacks to control model behavior during training.

**Topics Covered**:
- Early stopping
- Checkpointing
- Learning rate scheduling

**New Terms**:
- **Callback**: Functions executed at specific stages of training.
- **Checkpointing**: Saving the best model weights.
- **Early Stopping**: Halting training when validation performance stops improving.

### 🌍 Lesson 6: Data Pollution & Power
**Summary**: Reviewed the socio-political and environmental implications of data usage in AI based on the white paper from the Sustainable AI Lab, University of Bonn.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Data Pollution**: Harm caused by the production and storage of digital data.
- **Global Power Dynamics**: Influence of governments and corporations on AI ethics.
